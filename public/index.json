But when Friday evening rolls around and you realize you have zero plans? Gardening is always an option but maybe there is something more interesting. My wife and I would end up in this Thursday/Friday night ritual where I\u0026rsquo;d spend an hour or two hunting through Facebook events, local forums, and random websites trying to find something interesting happening within reasonable driving distance.\nThe local social media groups? They\u0026rsquo;re mostly people selling furniture and complaining about potholes. Not exactly a goldmine for weekend inspiration.\nEnter: The Weekend Concierge # Last weekend I finally had enough time and decided to build something about it. I fired up n8n (my favorite automation tool these days) and spent a few hours putting together what I\u0026rsquo;m calling my \u0026ldquo;AI concierge\u0026rdquo; agent.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what it does: every week, it automatically searches for events, activities, and interesting stuff happening in our area. Then it uses AI to filter through everything based on what my wife and I actually like – no random concerts, networking events or kids\u0026rsquo; birthday party venues, thank you very much. Finally, it packages everything into a neat little newsletter that lands in our inbox. And it learns to be better each time.\nHow It Works # The workflow isn\u0026rsquo;t rocket science, (it is a simple recommendation engine after all using RAG architecture) but it feels like magic when it works:\nData gathering – It pulls events from various sources (local websites, event aggregators, even some scraped content from regional tourism pages) AI filtering – This is what makes the difference. I feed all the raw event data into an AI model with a prompt about our preferences: outdoor activities, live music, food markets, anything cultural but not too fancy, that kind of thing. And it is also linked with a database of past events we liked the most. Newsletter generation – The filtered results get formatted into a readable email with dates, locations, and why the AI thinks we might like each thing Weekly delivery – Every Wednesday morning, there it is in our inbox The Best Part # I don\u0026rsquo;t think about it anymore. That\u0026rsquo;s the whole point. No more \u0026ldquo;I guess we\u0026rsquo;ll just stay home again\u0026rdquo; weekends because I forgot to plan ahead.\nAnd honestly? The AI does a better job than I did manually. It catches stuff I would\u0026rsquo;ve missed, and it\u0026rsquo;s way better at connecting the dots between what we liked before and what might interest us next.\nWorth the Time? # Took me maybe 3-4 hours to set up including all the testing and tweaking. I\u0026rsquo;ve already saved more time than that just in the past month, and we\u0026rsquo;ve actually done more interesting things because the planning friction is gone.\nBut hold on \u0026hellip;. can I make it as a personal, super focused event recommendation service to wider public that will look at individual preferences? I may spend more time on enhancing this simple flow. In the meantime: download this n8n workflow and set this up for yourself. Just add your credentials and change preferences in \u0026lsquo;parameters\u0026rsquo; step. Enjoy.\n","date":"7 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/ai-concierge/","section":"Projects","summary":"So here\u0026rsquo;s a problem I never thought I\u0026rsquo;d automate away: figuring out what to do on weekends.","title":"AI Concierge","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"7 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/badges/automation/","section":"Badges","summary":"","title":"Automation","type":"badges"},{"content":"","date":"7 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/badges/","section":"Badges","summary":"","title":"Badges","type":"badges"},{"content":"","date":"7 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/badges/n8n/","section":"Badges","summary":"","title":"N8n","type":"badges"},{"content":"","date":"7 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Projects","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"7 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/badges/weekend-project/","section":"Badges","summary":"","title":"Weekend-Project","type":"badges"},{"content":"","date":"25 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/badges/crypto/","section":"Badges","summary":"","title":"Crypto","type":"badges"},{"content":"","date":"25 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/badges/simple/","section":"Badges","summary":"","title":"Simple","type":"badges"},{"content":" 🚀 My Journey into Vibe Coding: Building a Crypto Correlation Explorer # The Spark 💡 # Sometimes the best projects start with a simple question and an afternoon of pure coding flow. That\u0026rsquo;s exactly how my latest venture into vibe coding began - that magical state where curiosity meets creativity, and before you know it, you\u0026rsquo;re knee-deep in building something genuinely exciting.\nThe Project: Crypto Correlation Visualization 📊 # I decided to dive into the fascinating world of cryptocurrency relationships. My goal? Create an interactive application that visualizes correlations between different tokens and uncovers the hidden patterns in crypto market movements.\nWhat I Built # Using Google AI Studio, I crafted an application that:\nVisualizes token relationships through interactive correlation matrices Analyzes log returns to understand price movement patterns Explores statistical relationships between different cryptocurrencies Backtests a trading strategy which uses those relationships Do you want to see results? Check it out! The Technical Deep Dive 🔬 # The statistical foundation includes:\nLog return analysis for normalized price comparisons Correlation mapping to identify strongly related token pairs Cointegration tests to validate if two pairs move together (Johansen\u0026rsquo;s test) These statistical tools are crucial for understanding whether crypto pairs represent a true relationship - essential knowledge for any serious trading strategy.\nThe Vision: Beyond Visualization 🎯 # This isn\u0026rsquo;t just another data visualization project. I\u0026rsquo;m building toward something bigger: a full-scale trading platform focused on market-neutral strategies like pair trading.\nImagine identifying crypto pairs that historically move together, then capitalizing on temporary divergences through sophisticated algorithmic trading. That\u0026rsquo;s the endgame.\nWhy Vibe Coding Works ✨ # This project perfectly captures what vibe coding is all about:\nFollowing curiosity rather than rigid planning Building iteratively from simple visualizations to complex systems Letting the data guide the development process Staying open to where the project naturally evolves What\u0026rsquo;s Next? # The roadmap is exciting:\nImplement cointegration testing algorithms 🏁 Add automatic data refresh 🏁 Build backtesting capabilities 🏁 Integrate trading strategy with your Ex/Dex of choice Quick update: # After spending one more evening on my application it now has a strategy builder module. You can test how a market-neutral strategy performs depending on various parameters. You can also use AI-driven helper! I still have a few issues to solve: speed is one of those.

It\u0026rsquo;s been published under 3 domains:\ncryptopair.xyz\ncryptopairs.xyz\ncryptocorrelations.xyz\nSometimes the best way to learn is to just start building. This crypto correlation explorer started as a weekend experiment and is growing into something that may be actually helpful in my adventure with crypto. That\u0026rsquo;s the power of vibe coding - you never know where the journey will take you.\nReady to start your own vibe coding adventure?
