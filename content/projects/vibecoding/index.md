# 🚀 My Journey into Vibe Coding: Building a Crypto Correlation Explorer

## The Spark 💡

Sometimes the best projects start with a simple question and an afternoon of pure coding flow. That's exactly how my latest venture into **vibe coding** began - that magical state where curiosity meets creativity, and before you know it, you're knee-deep in building something genuinely exciting.

## The Project: Crypto Correlation Visualization 📊

I decided to dive into the fascinating world of cryptocurrency relationships. My goal? Create an interactive application that visualizes correlations between different tokens and uncovers the hidden patterns in crypto market movements.

### What I Built

Using **Google AI Studio**, I crafted an application that:

- **Visualizes token relationships** through interactive correlation matrices
- **Analyzes log returns** to understand price movement patterns 
- **Explores statistical relationships** between different cryptocurrencies
- **Backtests a trading strategy** which uses those relationships

## The Technical Deep Dive 🔬

The statistical foundation includes:

- **Log return analysis** for normalized price comparisons
- **Correlation mapping** to identify strongly related token pairs
- **Cointegration tests** to validate if two pairs move together (Johansen's test)

These statistical tools are crucial for understanding whether crypto pairs represent a true relationship - essential knowledge for any serious trading strategy.

## The Vision: Beyond Visualization 🎯

This isn't just another data visualization project. I'm building toward something bigger: a **full-scale trading platform** focused on market-neutral strategies like pair trading. 

Imagine identifying crypto pairs that historically move together, then capitalizing on temporary divergences through sophisticated algorithmic trading. That's the endgame.

## Why Vibe Coding Works ✨

This project perfectly captures what vibe coding is all about:
- **Following curiosity** rather than rigid planning
- **Building iteratively** from simple visualizations to complex systems 
- **Letting the data guide** the development process
- **Staying open** to where the project naturally evolves

## What's Next?

The roadmap is exciting:
1. ~~Implement cointegration testing algorithms~~   🏁
2. ~~Add automatic data refresh~~                   🏁
3. ~~Build backtesting capabilities~~               🏁
4. Integrate trading strategy with your Ex/Dex of choice 

## Quick update:

After spending one more evening on my application it now has a strategy builder module. You can test how a market-neutral strategy performs depending on various parameters. You can also use AI-driven helper!
I still have a few issues to solve: speed is one of those. When you click 'Simulate' - give yourself a break, make a coffee, call a friend or watch next episode of your favourite show.

*Sometimes the best way to learn is to just start building. This crypto correlation explorer started as a weekend experiment and is growing into something that may be actually helpful in my adventure with crypto. That's the power of vibe coding - you never know where the journey will take you.*
