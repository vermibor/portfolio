# How I Built an Automated Workflow to Hunt Trends & Launch Niche Websites

Staying ahead of trends and picking the *right* one to pursue can feel impossible without a dedicated team. So, I built a system that does almost everything **automatically** - and it’s been quite a ride!

## What I Created

Using advanced workflows in **[n8n](https://n8n.io/)**, I set up an automated pipeline that:

- **Scans newsletters and data sources** to identify trending topics
- Applies <a href="n8n/keyword_classifier.json" download>quality filters</a> to select the most promising trends
- <a href="n8n/get_domain_proposal.json" download>Randomly picks a weekly set of trends</a> to analyze further
- Crafts a **strategy for simple, niche websites** based on these trends
- Uses AI workflow<a href="n8n/value_estimation.json" download> to estimate the value and potential</a> of each site
- Passes the best candidates to me - the human in the loop - for final approval
- Automatically **executes website creation and deployment** through my hosting provider

This automation lets me launch new niche sites lightning-fast, freeing up time to focus on growth and strategy.

> **Next steps:** Optimize SEO and content management to boost traffic and engagement.

## Why I’m Doing This

- **Learn by doing:** Each project helps me sharpen my automation and domain-building skills
- **Build a portfolio:** Over time, I’ll create a collection of valuable domains that could be auctioned or monetized
- **Test cutting-edge AI & automation tools** in a real-world workflow
