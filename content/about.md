Hello! I'm a hobbyist exploring the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence and DIY tech during my afterhours. My journey started with the fundamentals of machine learning, and I've since delved into deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. I find immense satisfaction in bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and tangible, working projects.

Driven by curiosity, I continuously experiment with new algorithms, frameworks, automation platforms and hardware. This showcase is a collection of some of my explorations, ranging from practical tools to purely experimental concepts.

Beyond the code, I believe in the potential of AI to be a creative and problem-solving tool. My focus is often on building systems that are not only functional but also intuitive and perhaps even a little fun. I'm always learning and eager to tackle the next challenge.
